## Description of data set(s)
* [Weed Price by State](https://github.com/frankbi/price-of-weed/tree/master/data)
* [Median Household Income by State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_income)
## How We Aim to Make This Data Alive
* Show a map of the United States with each state shaded a different color of green depending on the ratio of the median household income to the weed price within the state
* Users can hover over states to get specific information about each state such as cost of weed within that state for the different qualities of weed, the median household income within that state, and the exact ratio of household income to weed price ratio
